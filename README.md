<summary>More About Me &#43;</summary>


```html
My Story:
I am passionate about JavaScript and web technologies. Before the pandemic,
I was a struggling entrepreneur in the clothing industry. 'Cotton Logic'
is a company where I hustled as a rainmaker. My business had its ups and downs,
which were stressful, but I was learning something new every day. During the pandemic,
I decided to bring my passion into the business. Nowadays, two roles in my real-life game are:
'Web Development Service' and Rainmaking for 'Clogic'. 

I Speak:
English, Bangla (Native), Taglish, Hindi, and of course Javascript!

Certification:
I'm a Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) certified full-stack web developer on a journey
of modern web mastery at the University of Helsinki.
