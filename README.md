<summary>More About Me &#43;</summary>
  
```html
🙂 My Story:
I am passionate about JavaScript and web technologies. Before the pandemic, I was a struggling entrepreneur in the clothing industry.
'Cotton Logic' is a company where I hustled as a rainmaker. My business had its ups and downs, which were stressful, but I was learning
something new every day. During the pandemic, I decided to bring my passion into the business. Nowadays, two roles in my real-life game are:
'Web Development Service' and Rainmaking for 'Cotton Logic'. 

👩‍💻 I Speak:
English, Bangla(Native), Taglish, Hindi, and of course JavaScript!

🎓 Certification:
I'm a Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) certified full-stack web developer
on a journey of modern web mastery at the University of Helsinki.
