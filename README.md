<summary>More About Me &#43;</summary>


```html
My Story:
I'm passionate about Javascript and web technologies. Before the pandemic, I was just a struggling entrepreneur in
the clothing industry. 'Cotton Logic' is a company where I hustled as a rainmaker. My business had its ups and
downs, which was stressful, but I learned something new daily. During the pandemic, I decided to bring my passion
into the business. Nowadays, two roles in my real-life games are Web developer and Rainmaker. 

I can Speak:
English, Bangla (Native), Taglish, Hindi, and of course Javascript!

Certification:
I'm a Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) certified full-stack web developer on a journey
of modern web mastery at the University of Helsinki.
